## Hey! I'm @nxexox (Deys Timofey) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer and ML engineer.

I have been building APIs and tools for Machine Learning and data systems with different teams and organizations.

I have created many commercial tools in the field of ML. Now I want to channel my experience into the open source community. ðŸš€

Now I'm working on ML tools and MLOps tools, called [MLup](https://mlup.org).

If my open source projects are useful for your product/company you can also sponsor my work on them. â˜•

You can find me on:

* [GitHub as @tiangolo (you are here)](https://github.com/nxexox)
* [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/nxexox)
